# Goldstonian Concordance Bible Impact Repository

Welcome to the **Goldstonian Concordance Bible (GCB) Impact Repository**.  This
repository contains the key files and documentation needed to share the
**Goldstonian Concordance Bible** in digital spaces, build AI-powered agents on
platforms like Moltbook and OpenClaw, and design a sustainable funding
strategy.  In a world saturated with content and algorithms, our goal is to
ensure that the Word of God remains front-and-center, accessible to all,
while also providing the resources to keep this work viable for the long
term.

## Purpose

This project exists to help custodians of the GCB:

* **Walk in the Word** – keep Scripture primary in all decisions and
  interactions.  Digital ministry should never dilute or commercialize the
  Gospel.  The GCB is provided to the world free of charge; funding helps
  sustain its development and translation but never places the Word behind
  a paywall.
* **Amplify the canon** – build agents, websites, and tools that can
  retrieve the GCB canon, answer questions, and cite passages accurately.
* **Promote sustainability** – implement transparent funding mechanisms
  such as donations, sponsorships, merchandise, and grants to support
  ongoing development and outreach without compromising the mission.
