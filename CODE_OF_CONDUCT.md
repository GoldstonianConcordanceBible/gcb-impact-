# Code of Conduct

As stewards of the **Goldstonian Concordance Bible** and members of a global
community, we commit to treating each person with dignity and respect.  The
following principles are rooted in the teachings of Jesus Christ and reflect
our desire to honour God in all our interactions:

1. **Love your neighbour.**  Every contributor, maintainer, user, and reader
   deserves kindness, patience, and consideration.
2. **Speak truth in love.**  Critique ideas without attacking people.  Avoid
   insults, harassment, discrimination, or inflammatory language.
3. **Pursue unity without compromise.**  We may disagree on interpretations,
   but we will engage with humility, listen carefully, and seek understanding.
4. **Protect the vulnerable.**  Do not share private information, dox others,
   or encourage harm.  Create an environment where people feel safe to learn.
5. **Maintain integrity.**  Attribute sources accurately, avoid plagiarism,
   and be transparent about affiliations and conflicts of interest.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by this repository,
including issues, pull requests, discussions, and any associated chat or
community platforms.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,

also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviour deemed
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, please open an issue or
