# Contributing to the GCB Impact Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  The **Goldstonian Concordance
Bible (GCB)** is a living project that thrives when believers, developers,
scholars and volunteers work together.  Your contributions will help us
improve the canon index, build better agents, and spread the Word of God.

## Before you begin

1. **Pray and read the mission.**  Please read `docs/MISSION.md` first.  This
   repository exists to honour Christ and keep Scripture accessible.
2. **Check existing issues.**  Search the Issues tab for related requests
   before opening a new one.
3. **Keep changes focused.**  Small, well-scoped pull requests are easier to
   review and merge.

## What you can contribute

### Documentation and ministry resources

* Improve the README and guides.
* Add examples of study guides, reading plans and devotionals (ensure they are
  your own original work or properly licensed).
* Improve clarity and accessibility (simplify language, add diagrams, etc.).

### Agent skills and tooling

* Create new OpenClaw skills that reference the GCB repositories and cite file
  paths.
* Add parsers, indexers or data manifests that help agents retrieve Scripture.
* Improve security, testing and reproducibility.

### Data and metadata

* Expand controlled vocabularies and crosswalk CSVs.
* Add translations or language metadata.
* Validate the canonical index, book identifiers, and link integrity.

## Style guide (quick)

* Use clear headings and short paragraphs.
* Prefer lists and checklists for actionable steps.
* When referencing another repository, include the full GitHub URL.
* Avoid sensationalism.  This is Scripture-centered work.
