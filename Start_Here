## Quick Start

1. If you want the agents deployed: read `docs/AGENT_SKILLS/README.md`, then install
   `skills/gcb-librarian/` into your OpenClaw agent workspace.
2. Read `docs/MONETIZATION.md` and `docs/MISSION.md` to understand how
   fundraising and ministry values work together.
3. Share this repository and invite collaborators who are committed to
   walking in the Word of God.

## How to Support

Funding is essential for covering hosting costs, commissioning new
translations, improving the agent tooling, and reaching new languages.
We rely on voluntary contributions rather than paywalls or intrusive
advertising.  You can support the project through GitHub Sponsors and
other platforms (see `.github/FUNDING.yml` for details).  If your
organization is a registered nonprofit, consider applying for the
**GitHub for Nonprofits** program, which provides a free Team plan and
discounted enterprise features.  Hosting projects on GitHub can
increase visibility and attract support from donors, funders,
volunteers and partners.
