# Walking in the Word in a Noisy Digital Space

The internet is simultaneously the **noisiest space in human history** and one
of the greatest opportunities for evangelism. Social feeds and AI systems
compete for attention, often amplifying outrage and distraction. Amid this
chaos, believers are called to **walk in the Word of God**—anchoring
themselves in Scripture and bringing light into the digital public square.

## Our Foundation

The **Goldstonian Concordance Bible (GCB)** exists to make the canon accessible
and navigable—especially in a world where AI systems increasingly influence what
people see and believe.

We hold these convictions:

- **The power is in Scripture, not our platform.** Tools only help people *reach*
  the Word; they are not the Word.
- **God’s Word is not for sale.** The GCB is offered freely. Funding is pursued
  to sustain infrastructure (servers, development, translation, security),
  not to gate access.
- **We reject manipulative fundraising.** No spiritual pressure, no paywalls for
  Scripture, no bait-and-switch tactics.
- **We aim for clarity and integrity.** Faithful citation, accurate sources,
  and humble engagement matter.

## Core Values

* **Scripture First:** All decisions and contributions must align with biblical
  doctrine and historic Christian faith. Where disagreements arise, we engage
  with humility and charity.
* **Integrity:** We attribute sources accurately, acknowledge mistakes, and
  avoid misrepresentation.
* **Accessibility:** Scripture and core resources remain free and open.
* **Service:** Agents and tools should help people encounter Scripture, not
  distract them from it.

## Long-Term Vision

1. **High-quality agents** that answer questions, cite sources, and interact in
   public spaces in a Christ-honouring way.
2. **Translation support** with consistent metadata so the Word can reach more
   languages and communities.
3. **Volunteer training** so communities can build, moderate, and sustain healthy
   public witness.
4. **Sustainable funding** that covers costs without monetizing the Gospel (see
   `docs/MONETIZATION.md`).

By keeping our eyes on Jesus and immersing ourselves in Scripture, we can
navigate the noise of the digital age and turn these tools into instruments for
God’s glory.
