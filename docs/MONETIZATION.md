# Sustainable Funding Strategies

> **Non-negotiable:** The Goldstonian Concordance Bible (GCB) is a free resource.
> Funding exists to cover hosting, development, translation, security, and
> community support—never to restrict Scripture or manipulate believers.

This document summarises proven funding models used in open-source projects and
mission-driven communities. The goal is **sustainability with integrity**.

## Guiding Rules

1. **Never gate Scripture** behind a paywall.
2. **Be transparent**: explain what funds cover (hosting, translation, editing,
   security, scholarships, tooling).
3. **Avoid spiritual pressure**: no “God told me you must give” tactics.
4. **Separate access from support**: supporters get *extra convenience* or
   *extra community*, not “more Bible.”
5. **Publish a simple monthly update**: what was built, what funds covered,
   what’s next.

## 1) Donation Buttons (Fastest Start)

Place a clear donate option in:
- GitHub sponsor button (`.github/FUNDING.yml`)
- README “Support” section
- Your main website landing page

**Pros**
- Low setup, low maintenance
- Works worldwide with multiple payment options

**Cons**
- Usually modest revenue unless you communicate consistently

**Best practices**
- Offer at least 2–3 options (card + PayPal + low-friction option)
- State what a gift funds (“$10 covers X”)

---

## 2) Recurring Sponsorship (Most Stable)

Use platforms like:
- GitHub Sponsors
- Open Collective
- Patreon / membership systems
- Ko-fi / Liberapay / similar

**Pros**
- Predictable cashflow
- Helps planning and staffing

**Cons**
- Requires ongoing communication and update rhythm

**Make it ethical**
- Give supporters updates, early access to *tools*, behind-the-scenes notes,
  Q&A sessions, or printable study aids—**not restricted Scripture**.

---

## 3) Bounties (Good for Specific Tasks)

Bounties work well for:
- parsing scripts
- index improvements
- translation tooling
- security fixes

**Pros**
- Money tied to clear deliverables
- Attracts skilled contributors

**Cons**
- Not recurring revenue
- Can attract low-quality “rush PRs” if not curated

---

## 4) Sponsorware / “Unlocking the Commons” (Advanced)

Build a tool privately, and commit to open-sourcing it after sponsorship
goals are hit.

**Pros**
- Funds development before public release
- Creates “market signal” for what people value

**Cons**
- Easy to misunderstand; requires clear communication
- Not suitable for already-released work

---

## 5) Crowdfunding (Milestone Funding)

Use one-time crowdfunding for:
- a major translation push
- a new volume’s companion index
- a mobile app build
- a “school year” curriculum release

**Pros**
- Can raise meaningful one-time funds
- Strong narrative momentum

**Cons**
- Requires marketing + clear deliverables
- Fulfillment can become work (shipping, perks)

---

## 6) Books, Print Study Guides, and Paid Content (Optional)

This works well when the paid item is:
- a printed companion
- a study workbook
- a curriculum guide
- a course that teaches *how to study*

**Guardrail**
- The paid product must be “help applying Scripture,” not “pay to access Scripture.”

---

## 7) Services: Training, Consulting, Support (High Potential)

Examples:
- Church training: “How to build Scripture-grounded AI agents safely”
- Setup packages: “Canonical index + website + workflows”
- Support contracts for institutions

**Pros**
- Higher revenue per client
- Builds partnerships

**Cons**
- Time-intensive; can distract from core mission if unmanaged

---

## 8) Grants and Philanthropy (High Effort, High Reward)

Possible grant categories:
- education
- translation / literacy
- digital humanities
- open knowledge / open tools
- faith-based philanthropic partners

**Tip**
- Keep a metrics page: languages supported, number of volumes indexed, number of
  citations served, number of study plans created, etc.

---

## Recommended Mix (Simple + Powerful)

A practical starting mix:

1) GitHub Sponsors + donate links (recurring + one-time)  
2) Printed companions / study guides (ethical paid content)  
3) One annual crowdfunding milestone (translation/tooling)  
4) A small services offering (training/setup)  
5) Grants when you have stable metrics and documentation
